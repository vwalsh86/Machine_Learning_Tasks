### <i>Description:</i> 
<br>
This repository contains work that I have completed for the assessment part of my course entitled 'Tasks 2020' which is an aspect of the module Machine Learning and Statistics. 
<br>
This repository is made up of 4 seperate tasks / assignments that is solely my own work that has been created and developed during this college terms. 
<br>
I have used the open-source option, Jupyter Notebook, as my method of creating and adding to my GitHub repository. Information on what the Jupyter Notebook is along with Installation and How-To info can be found here: https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
<br>
It is my intention to build upon this repository through a series of regular commits which will portray consistency in my work and allow time management to not be an issue. 
<br>
I confirm that the work displayed within this repository will be of my own and I commit to reference and acknowledge any other persons work as apart of my research for completing this repository.
<br>

This repository is intended to contain a combination of: </br>
<ul>
  <li>Text</li>
  <li>Code (Python)</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Graphs</li>
  <li>Use of LaTeX</li>
</ul>

### How to run a Jupyter Notebook
In order to run Jupyter Notebook on a machine, you need the programming language Python to be pre-installed. <br>

<p><strong><i>"While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the Jupyter Notebook itself."</i></strong></p>
<br>
I already have the Anaconda package installed on my computer, which includes the Python language. Once I ensured I was on the latest software version of this, I was able to run Jupyter without difficulties.<br>
If you wish to install the Anaconda package aswell, here is the link: https://www.anaconda.com/download
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>To run The Jupyter Notebook, I firstly opened the Command Prompt (Windows PC) and changed the location to the desired folder that housed the repository contents. (Note: The machine which you are using will determine the type of command window you use, i.e. Windows / Mac) </li>
    <li>Once in the desired folder, I chose to run Jupyter but entering the command <ins>'jupyter notebook'</ins> and pressing <ins>'Enter'</ins> on my keyboard. After a few moments, the Jupyter Notebook will launch within a browser window which allows you to begin working on and contributing to the notebook using the internal parts of Jupyter including Markdown cells and Code cells. With Markdown cells <i>"you can document the computational process in a literate way, alternating descriptive text with code, using rich text."</i> </li> <br>
    <li>Throughout the usage of the Juypter Notebook, the Command Prompt window remains open in the background creating backups of your content from Jupyter while you make contributions.</li>
    <li>When you have finished making contributions to your repository and wish to end the session, it is best practice to close all Jupyter Notebook tabs <strong>before</strong> interacting with the Command Prompt window.</li>
    <li>In order to successfully end a Jupyter session, press Ctrl + C while in the Command Prompt window. This will fully shut down and terminate the connection to Jupyter.</li>
    <li>At this point, it is extremely important to remember that you need to <i>'commit</i> your work to GitHub in order to complete and fully save your work to your repository. If you choose to close Command Prompt without doing this, you will abandon and lose all work made during this commitment.</li>
    <li>To complete and commit work to GitHub from the Command Prompt, I chose to enter these prompts in the following order: **<i> 1. git status , 2. git add . , 3. git commit -m "add message for contribution as a comment", 4. git push**</i> </li>
</ul>

### Task Description:

#### Task 1: Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places.
#### Task 2: Chi-squared test: Use scipy.stats to verify this value and calculate the associated p value.
#### Task 3: Research these Excel functions STDEV.P and STDEV.S
#### Task 4: Use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to Fisher’s famous Iris data set.
